          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The meta element contains information that is used by the browser for example - charset UTF-8</li>
          <li>There should only be one h1 per webpage</li>
          <li>You always classify what type of DOCTYPE you're using</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
          <li>All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the body element.</li>
          <li>src attribute is most important inside an img element as it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>the br element creates an empty line break between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>The anchor element a creates links to the same webpage or other webpages by href plus URL</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS</li>
        <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
        <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a  style > element in the  head > element</li>
        <li>the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a     link > element placed in the HTML's <head></li>

        <li>The git command must precede every Git statement</li>
        <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch</li>
        <li>The -b flag creates a new branch</li>
        <li>git add -A The -A flag indicates that we want to add all
          changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit</li>
          <li> git pull origin main Then use the pull command to receive a branch'
             modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source
             of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case,
              we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>he location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.
        </li>
        <li>By using a for loop, we can tell the computer to go through each of the shapes in our array and log them to the console until there are no shapes left. </li>
        <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the following line of code:
            var x = 0;</li>
            <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code:
              x < shapes.length;</li>
              <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code:
                x++</li>
      </ul>
